# Family Dealership
Family Dealership is a react application that facilitates the purchasing
of vehicles.  Employees are able to add vehicles based on what is 
available on the lot; customers are then able to place an offer on the 
vehicles that interest them.  These offers are then reviewed by the 
employees and either accepted or rejected.  Customers also have the 
ability to make payments and manage their vehicles.
